    <h2>Health consequences for Latinx children</h2>

<p>A new study reveals the dire health consequences for Latinx children due to anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies.
Boody text: Washington, D.C. – The health and well-being of Latinx children are under attack as a direct result of 
the damaging impact of anti-immigrant rhetoric and xenophobic policies championed by anti-immigrant politicians. 
A study published last week by the American Academy of Pediatrics and featured in CNN, exposes the heart-wrenching 
reality: Latinx children living in states promoting anti-immigrant policies are at significantly higher risks of 
experiencing mental and chronic physical health conditions throughout their lives.</p>

<p>The study makes clear the life-threatening health disparities that Latinx children – regardless of their own 
immigration status or that of their parents – experience when exposed to anti-immigrant policies. These findings are 
consistent with UWD’s 2021 UndocuHealth report which similarly found the toll that racist and xenophobic policies have 
on the mental health of immigrant youth.</p>

<h2>Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, Deputy Director of Federal Advocacy of United We Dream, said:</h2>

<p><em>“The harmful impact of racism and xenophobia on Latinx children is a stark reminder of the 
inhumanity displayed by anti-immigrant politicians. Despite this cruel reality, some politicians 
continue to promote xenophobic policies that target immigrants for their own political gain, while 
disregarding the life-threatening consequences these actions have on our children. These intentional, 
deadly outcomes are undeniable proof that white nationalism poses the greatest threat to our community’s 
health and well-being. It is crucial for Congress and the Department of Health & Human Services to 
investigate policies that harm immigrants, address these troubling health inequities, and hold those 
accountable for the irreversible damage they continue to cause for these Latinx children.”</em></p>
