<h3>Immigration rights information: The official bill</h3>

<div class="act">
<h2>Introduced in Senate (02/09/2023)
Dream Act of 2023</h2>

<p>This bill directs the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to cancel removal and grant 
lawful permanent resident status on a conditional basis to certain non-U.S. nationals 
(aliens under federal law) who initially entered the United States as minors (younger than 18 years of age).</p>

<p>Specifically, DHS must do so for such an individual who (1) is inadmissible, is deportable, 
or has temporary protected status; (2) has been continuously physically present in the United 
States for four years preceding this bill's enactment; (3) is not inadmissible on various grounds 
such as those related to crime or security; and (4) has fulfilled specified educational requirements.</p>

<p>DHS must also do so for an individual who was granted Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals 
(DACA) status unless the individual has engaged in conduct that would make the individual ineligible for DACA.</p>

<p>DHS shall remove the conditional basis of the lawful permanent resident status granted under this bill 
if the individual meets various requirements, such as (1) maintaining residence in the United States, 
and (2) acquiring a degree from an institution of higher education or serving in the uniformed services.</p>

<p>DHS may not disclose or use information provided in applications filed under this bill or 
in DACA requests for immigration enforcement purposes.</p>

<p>The bill also repeals a restriction barring states from providing higher education benefits to undocumented 
aliens unless those benefits are available to all U.S. citizens.</p>
